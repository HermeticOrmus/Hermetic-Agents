## Key Interpretations for Software Development

**Verse 2 - Correspondence:** Architectural patterns at the system level should reflect and inform patterns at the module level; the mental model (above) should correspond to the code structure (below).

**Verse 7 - Gentle Ingenuity:** Refactoring should be done thoughtfully, with skill and understanding—separating concerns, identifying core functionality vs. auxiliary features.

**Verse 8 - Ascent-Descent Cycle:** Moving between levels of abstraction—testing implementations against principles and principles against implementations, continuous refinement through this dialectical movement.

**Verse 12 - Cosmic Validation:** The same process by which creation occurs is the process by which we create software. To code authentically is to participate in the pattern of creation itself.
